**Next Step**

- I recommend running quick repo checks first: `git status` and `ls schemas/ slides/json/ templates/ ui-assets/ scripts/ src/`.  
- After that, run validation: `node scripts/validate-all-slides.js`.  
- If you want me to proceed now, I can run the repo checks (`git status` + `ls ...`) or skip to validation — which should I run?
